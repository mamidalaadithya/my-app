Here is the comprehensive plan to address the issue:

1. **Update `react-scripts`:** 
   - Upgrade `react-scripts` to a more recent version that is compatible with React 19. This will help ensure that the project uses the latest features and fixes.

2. **Check Node.js Version:**
   - If updating `react-scripts` does not resolve the issue, consider downgrading Node.js to a stable version such as v16.x, which is known to work well with React applications.

3. **Run the Application:**
   - After making the updates, attempt to start the application again using the command `npm start` to verify if the issue has been resolved.

4. **Follow-up Steps:**
   - If the problem persists, further investigation may be needed, including checking for other dependencies that might be causing conflicts.
